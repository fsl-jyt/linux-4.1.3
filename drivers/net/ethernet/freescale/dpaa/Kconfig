	  The size in bytes of the egress Congestion State notification threshold on 1G ports.
	  The 1G dTSECs can quite easily be flooded by cores doing Tx in a tight loop
	  (e.g. by sending UDP datagrams at "while(1) speed"),
	  and the larger the frame size, the more acute the problem.
	  So we have to find a balance between these factors:
	       - avoiding the device staying congested for a prolonged time (risking
                 the netdev watchdog to fire - see also the tx_timeout module param);
               - affecting performance of protocols such as TCP, which otherwise
	         behave well under the congestion notification mechanism;
	       - preventing the Tx cores from tightly-looping (as if the congestion
	         threshold was too low to be effective);
	       - running out of memory if the CS threshold is set too high.
