	bool "Use driver's Tx queue selection mechanism"

	---help---
	  The DPAA-Ethernet driver defines a ndo_select_queue() callback for optimal selection
	  of the egress FQ. That will override the XPS support for this netdevice.
	  If for whatever reason you want to be in control of the egress FQ-to-CPU selection and mapping,
	  or simply don't want to use the driver's ndo_select_queue() callback, then unselect this
	  and use the standard XPS support instead.

	---help---
	  The size in bytes of the egress Congestion State notification threshold on 1G ports.
	  The 1G dTSECs can quite easily be flooded by cores doing Tx in a tight loop
	  (e.g. by sending UDP datagrams at "while(1) speed"),
	  and the larger the frame size, the more acute the problem.
	  So we have to find a balance between these factors:
	       - avoiding the device staying congested for a prolonged time (risking
                 the netdev watchdog to fire - see also the tx_timeout module param);
               - affecting performance of protocols such as TCP, which otherwise
	         behave well under the congestion notification mechanism;
	       - preventing the Tx cores from tightly-looping (as if the congestion
	         threshold was too low to be effective);
	       - running out of memory if the CS threshold is set too high.

config FSL_DPAA_INGRESS_CS_THRESHOLD
	hex "Ingress congestion threshold on FMan ports"
	default "0x10000000"
	---help---
	  The size in bytes of the ingress tail-drop threshold on FMan ports.
	  Traffic piling up above this value will be rejected by QMan and discarded by FMan.
